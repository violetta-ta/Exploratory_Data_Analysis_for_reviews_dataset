# Exploratory Data Analysis for reviews dataset.

In this project, I had a target to check the content of retail product reviews dataset and see some patterns which can be interesting and potentially lead to some business decesions.

I have chosen the dataset, located at https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html, which represents the 494485 reviews of the Amazon users in the category "Arts, Crafts and Sewing" for the years from March 2004 to October 2018. The dataset is reduced, which means it contains only the products with at least 5 reviews in each.
